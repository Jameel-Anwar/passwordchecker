# passwordchecker
This is a script to safely check for your password on your own personal computer without leaving a trace.
The API is from the website (pwned.passwords.com), credit all due to the original owner.

Copy this entire script onto your python file and save it in a new folder.
In that same new folder, create a new text file and type in any words but I RECOMMEND to have it in separate lines
i.e.

password 1

password 2

password 3


Instead of:

_password 1 password 2 password 3_

Then save your text file and then run the script and see the magic work!
